# Flow Recorder Feature

## Overview

The Flow Recorder is a new feature that allows users to record multi-step actions from natural language commands and create reusable flows. This brings us one step closer to a true natural language automation interface.

## Features

### üéØ Core Functionality

- **Record Multi-Step Actions**: Capture a sequence of natural language commands and their corresponding MCP tool executions
- **Reusable Flows**: Save and replay recorded flows for repeatable testing or setup
- **Clear Traceability**: Each action and its order is displayed in the saved flow
- **Team Sharing**: Publish flows across your team for collaboration

### üîß How It Works

1. **Start Recording**: Click the "üî¥ Record Flow" button in the chat interface
2. **Execute Commands**: Use natural language to trigger MCP tools (e.g., "draw 2 red circles", "connect circles with arrow")
3. **Automatic Capture**: Each command and its executed tools are automatically captured in order
4. **Stop Recording**: Click "‚èπÔ∏è Stop Recording" to finalize the flow
5. **Save & Name**: Provide a name and optional description for your flow
6. **Execute Later**: Run saved flows anytime from the "üìã Saved Flows" menu

### üìã Example Flow: Checkout Process

```
Hit record ‚Üí
"Login as test user" ‚Üí
"Go to produce tab" ‚Üí
"Add banana to cart" ‚Üí
"Add credit card" ‚Üí
"Click checkout" ‚Üí
Hit stop ‚Üí Save as "Checkout Flow"
```

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

- **FlowTypes.ts**: Defines TypeScript interfaces for Flow and FlowStep
- **FlowManager.ts**: Handles flow storage, retrieval, and execution
- **FlowRecorder.tsx**: React component for the recording UI
- **MCPChat.tsx**: Updated to integrate flow recording functionality

### Data Structure

```typescript
interface FlowStep {
  id: string;
  userMessage: string;
  assistantResponse: string;
  toolsUsed: Array<{
    tool: string;
    payload: any;
    elementId?: string;
  }>;
  timestamp: Date;
}

interface Flow {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  steps: FlowStep[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  isPublished?: boolean;
  workspaceId?: string;
}
```

### Storage

- Flows are stored in localStorage using the key `tess-excalidraw-flows`
- Automatic serialization/deserialization of Date objects
- Persistent across browser sessions

### Supported MCP Tools

The Flow Recorder works with all existing MCP tools:

- `drawSquare` - Create squares
- `drawCircle` - Create circles  
- `drawLine` - Create lines
- `addText` - Add text elements
- `addImage` - Add images
- `addFrame` - Create frames
- `move` - Move elements
- `moveTo` - Move elements to specific position
- `deleteElement` - Delete elements
- `editStroke` - Edit stroke properties
- `addArrow` - Create arrows between elements

## UI Components

### Flow Recorder Panel

- **Position**: Fixed top-right corner of the screen
- **Recording Controls**: Start/Stop recording buttons
- **Status Indicator**: Visual feedback during recording
- **Steps Preview**: Real-time display of captured steps
- **Saved Flows**: Access to all saved flows

### Dialogs

- **Save Flow Dialog**: Name and describe your flow
- **Flows List Dialog**: View, execute, and manage saved flows

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Simple Flow

1. Click "üî¥ Record Flow"
2. Type: "Draw a red square"
3. Type: "Add text 'Hello World' below the square"
4. Type: "Connect the square and text with an arrow"
5. Click "‚èπÔ∏è Stop Recording"
6. Name it "Simple Flow" and save

### Creating a Complex Flow

1. Click "üî¥ Record Flow"
2. Type: "Create a flowchart frame"
3. Type: "Add three boxes inside the frame"
4. Type: "Label the boxes 'Start', 'Process', 'End'"
5. Type: "Connect the boxes with arrows"
6. Type: "Add a title 'My Flowchart'"
7. Click "‚èπÔ∏è Stop Recording"
8. Name it "Flowchart Template" and save

## Benefits

### üß† Natural Language Only
Flows are built using natural language commands, making them accessible to non-technical users.

### üîÅ Reusable and Shareable
- Save flows for personal use
- Share flows with team members
- Publish flows to workspace for team-wide access

### üîç Clear Traceability
- Each step shows the user command and executed tools
- Timestamps for each action
- Visual representation of the flow sequence

### üöÄ Automation Ready
- Execute flows with a single click
- Perfect for repetitive tasks
- Ideal for testing scenarios

## Future Enhancements

- **Flow Templates**: Pre-built flows for common scenarios
- **Flow Versioning**: Track changes to flows over time
- **Flow Analytics**: Usage statistics and performance metrics
- **Flow Import/Export**: Share flows across different instances
- **Conditional Logic**: Add branching and conditional execution
- **Flow Scheduling**: Automatically execute flows at specific times

## Technical Notes

- The Flow Recorder integrates seamlessly with the existing MCP chat system
- Element IDs are automatically tracked and preserved for future reference
- Flows are executed sequentially with a 500ms delay between steps for better UX
- Error handling ensures graceful failure if a step cannot be executed
- The UI is responsive and works on mobile devices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Flow not recording**: Ensure you're in recording mode (red dot indicator visible)
2. **Tools not executing**: Check that the MCP server is running
3. **Flows not saving**: Check browser localStorage permissions
4. **Elements not found**: Ensure elements exist before trying to modify them

### Debug Information

- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Verify that all MCP tools are properly registered in `window`
- Ensure the Excalidraw app instance is available via `window.h`
