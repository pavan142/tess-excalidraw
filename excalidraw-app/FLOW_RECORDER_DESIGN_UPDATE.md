# Flow Recorder Design Update

## 🎯 Design Changes

The Flow Recorder has been redesigned to be **minimal and modern** by integrating all controls directly into the chat interface, eliminating the separate floating widget.

## 🔄 Before vs After

### Before: Separate Widget
- ❌ Floating widget in top-right corner
- ❌ Separate component with its own styling
- ❌ Disconnected from chat interface
- ❌ More complex UI with multiple overlays

### After: Integrated Design
- ✅ Flow controls embedded in chat header
- ✅ Single, cohesive interface
- ✅ Minimal and modern design
- ✅ Better user experience

## 🎨 New Design Features

### Header Integration
The flow recording controls are now seamlessly integrated into the chat header:

```
[AI Drawing Assistant] [🔴 Record] [📋 Flows (0)] [🗑️] [✕]
```

### Recording Status
When recording, a subtle yellow status bar appears below the header:
```
Recording... (2 steps) [red pulsing dot]
```

### Modal Dialogs
All dialogs (save flow, flows list) are now modal overlays that appear over the chat interface, maintaining focus and context.

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
- **Removed**: Separate `FlowRecorder.tsx` component
- **Integrated**: All flow functionality into `MCPChat.tsx`
- **Simplified**: Single component with unified state management

### State Management
```typescript
// Flow recording state
const [isRecording, setIsRecording] = useState(false);
const [recordedSteps, setRecordedSteps] = useState<FlowStep[]>([]);
const [currentFlow, setCurrentFlow] = useState<Flow | null>(null);

// Dialog state
const [showSaveDialog, setShowSaveDialog] = useState(false);
const [showFlowsList, setShowFlowsList] = useState(false);
const [flowName, setFlowName] = useState('');
const [flowDescription, setFlowDescription] = useState('');
```

### CSS Organization
- **Unified**: All styles in `MCPChat.scss`
- **Modular**: Clear class naming conventions
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly design
- **Consistent**: Matches existing chat styling

## 🎯 User Experience Improvements

### 1. **Minimal Design**
- Clean, uncluttered interface
